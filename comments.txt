Can you send me the exact package name for 'tkinter' via email? I wasn't able to get pip to install it, and I don't know if that's a problem with mu pip installation—sadly likely—or because I have the package name wrong. Other than that, I think I see where you're going with this, and the next step will be allowing someone to enter some dummy data. Without knowing the package you're using or seeing it in action, it's hard for me to give a lot of strong direction. So if a meeting is in order, let me know!
